R-trees package
This directory contains an implementation of the R-trees index structure,
written in C.

Here is a list of the files that should be present in the directory:

Makefile
README
allocate.c
assert.h
clock.c
error.c
graphics.c
index.c
index.h
macros.h
main.c
medium.ca
newtid.c
node.c
options.h
printstats.c
rectangle.c
sccs.h
small.ca
split.e.c
split.e.h
split.l.c
split.l.h
split.o.h
split.q.c
split.q.h
y.spec
y.tab.c

Makefile
Helps compile and link different versions of the program.

README
That's this file.

*.c, *.h files
These are C language source files.
Look at Makefile to see how the program is put together.

y.spec, y.tab.c
y.spec is an input file for yacc (see man yacc under Unix), which is
a parser generator.  yacc produces y.tab.c, a c source file which
is compiled with the others.

split*
There are three basic versions of the RTree program, called linear, quad
and exp, using different node split algorithms.  The differences are in
the files starting with "split..".

options.h
Editing options.h allows setting other parameters, such as the
page size and the number of dimensions.

main.c
The main program exercises the R-tree data structure, and prints
statistics.  It gets 2-dimensional spatial data by reading integrated
circuit layout descriptions from files with suffix .ca produced by CAESAR
(see below).

graphics.c
There is some optional graphics code, which was set up so that
one could watch the program working on VLSI layout data (it's fun
to watch).  This is set up for a certain device at Berkeley and
probably won't be much use.  The name of the file graphics.c
and grapics.o has been removed from lists in Makefile.
If you want graphics you should probably look at graphics.c
and adapt it to whatever facilities you have.

*.ca
These files contain integrated circuit layout data and are produced
by the CAESAR layout editor used at UC Berkeley.  Just a couple of
files are included for the exerciser program to use as test cases.
